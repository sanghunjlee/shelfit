# ShelfIt
A simple way to manage lists (or 'shelves') of items. 

## About 

Shelfit is a project I have wanted to implement for myself to organize various lists that started to grow exponentially ever since the COVID year. I've begun to form a concrete idea about building this CLI app after encountering the [ultralist](https://github.com/ultralist/ultralist) by Grant Ammons, whose open source code helped me learn a lot about how to implement this concept. 

Here are concepts that I wanted to focus the implemtation around:

1. Using "tags" to group & filter items
2. Ditching rating system to group & filter (I found rating distracting in terms of organizing)
3. Organizing items the way a library would organize its collection
